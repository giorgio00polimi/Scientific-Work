Beyond_BCS: This is a short review I made which analyse the limits of the Bardeen-Cooper-Shriffer (BCS) Theory in explaining the phenomenon of High Temperature Superconductitivity.

Magnetism and Superconductivity: These are Lecture Notes from the course of Magnetism and Superconductivity held by Prof. Ghiringhelli at the Master Degree in Physics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

Photonics: A very short review of some of the most important topics of the first part of the Photonics course held by  Prof. Valentini at the Master Degree in Physics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

Time Crystals for Students: This is part of a presentation me and some collegoues of mine made for the course of Solid State Physics held by Prof. Puppin at the Master Degree in Physics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

Quantum Phenomena in Low Dimensional System: These are Lecture Notes from the course of Quantum Phenomena in Low Dimensional Systems held by Prof. Bussetti at the Master Degree in Physics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. The Lecture Notes are written in agreement with the Professor of the course.
