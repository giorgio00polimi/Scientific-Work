Beyond BCS: This is a short review I made which analyses the limits of the Bardeen-Cooper-Shriffer (BCS) Theory in explaining the phenomenon of High Temperature Superconductitivity.

Magnetism and Superconductivity: These are Lecture Notes from the course of Magnetism and Superconductivity held by Prof. Ghiringhelli at the Master Degree in Physics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

Photonics: A very short review of some of the most important topics of the first part of the Photonics course held by  Prof. Valentini at the Master Degree in Physics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

Time Crystals for Students: This is part of a presentation that me and some colleagues of mine made for the course of Solid State Physics held by Prof. Puppin at the Master Degree in Physics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

Quantum Phenomena in Low Dimensional System: These are Lecture Notes from the course of Quantum Phenomena in Low Dimensional Systems held by Prof. Bussetti at the Master Degree in Physics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. The Lecture Notes were written in agreement with the Professor of the course.

EXODIA Article: EXODIA is a device me and a collegue of mine designed to help avoiding food waste. It was designed in the context of the course Digital System Design held by Prof. Salice at the Master Degree in Physics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. The device design has been made and printed by us using a CAD software and a 3D printer.
